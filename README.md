### Overview

**The Cocktail Curator** 
The point of my app is to take a spirits category and introduce the user to classic cocktails they may enjoy based on spirit of choice. Essentially also giving them a small description to go along with each cocktail. As this is something i've done for a living this is one of my interests and passion projects for sure.
<br>

### Wireframes

Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views.
Im having issues getting it to display in 3 different sizes on the actual website for some reason. However the app itself will be mobile focused and will include the media queries for all 3 sizes in the project itself. Desktop/Tablet/Phone

### MVP

**The Cocktrail Curator** So what i've decided to do is take my project 1 and totally revamp it with react. Since i had issues applying myself with the first project, i am going all out with this one. The cocktail curator will act as a database that allows you to search for cocktails based on spirit, or simply allow the curator to pick for you.

<br>

#### Goals

* Homepage properly describes the process and guides the user along the choosing process
* Cocktail layout acts as the stage for listing cocktails and ingredients
* All subsequent components will render based on spirit selection
* The spirits showpage will render a list of cocktails for that specific spirit
* A Random Cocktail option will allow for the user to quickly have a cocktail be suggested without having to specify anything
* All rendered pages will have easy navigation incorporated.
* Create a cocktail page
* Styling of info will be uniform and easy to follow along

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The header will contain the title as a nav back home._                         |
|     App      | functional |   y   |   n   | _The App will house the overall structure and the axios call._   |
|   Selector   | functional |   n   |   y   | _The Selector will be what renders the buttons to choose spirit of choice to start._     |
|   Cocktails    | functional |   n   |   y   | _The Cocktails component will render the list of cocktails base on spirit preference._|

#### Helper Functions

> Use this section to document all helper functionsâ€“ generic functions that can be reused in other applications.

|  Function  | Description                                |
| :--------: | :----------------------------------------- |
| API call toggle | _  const apiCall = async (str = "") => {
    if (str === "Random") {
      let data = await axios(URL2)
      updateDrinks(data.data.drinks)
    } else {
      let data = await axios(URL + spirit)
      updateDrinks(data.data.drinks)
    }
  }_ |

### Code Issues & Resolutions

            <Switch>
              <Route exact path="/Selector">
                <Selector apiCall={apiCall} updateSpirit={updateSpirit} />
              </Route>
            </Switch>

            The switch statement was vital in getting multpile components to render and transition, withou them i kept hitting the transition wall as nothing would actually load. At first i had multiple Routes in one switch statement but eventually the components wouldn't render any more, so in the end, to be safe i wrapped every Route in switch statements.
